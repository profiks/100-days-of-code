# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge

### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

### Start Date
January 9th, 2017.

## Rules
1. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
2. I will update my site https://profiks.github.io with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
3. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.
